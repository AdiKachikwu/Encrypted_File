# Encrypted_File
This is a basic file encryter using cryptography
A few notes for the code, This was made using one youtube video showing the math opf the the Vigenere Cypher and was a creation by me made using python, 
For the math, The encoding and Decrypt function are inverse of each other so as seen 
key_split[i % len(key_split)] 
This makes sure the key loops back once the i (integer of the loop) has went past the length of key
